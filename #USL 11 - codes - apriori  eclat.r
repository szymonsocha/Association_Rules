# data from one month of operation at a real-world grocery store
# 9,835 transactions, or about 327 transactions per day (roughly 30 transactions per hour in a 12 hour business day)
# adapted from the Groceries dataset in the Apriori R package

# all brand names can be removed from the purchases
# it reduces the number of groceries to a more manageable 169 types, using broad categories 
# such as chicken, frozen meals, margarine, and soda

# transactional data is stored in a slightly different format
# given the usual structure of the matrix format, all examples are required to have exactly the same set of features
# transactional data is more free-form
# usually each row in the data specifies a single exampleâ€”in this case, a transaction
# each record comprises a comma-separated list of any number of items, from one to many

# sparse matrix
# each row in the sparse matrix indicates a transaction
# there is a column (feature) for every item that could possibly appear in someone's shopping bag

# as additional transactions and items are added, 
# a conventional data structure quickly becomes too large to fit into memory

# sparse matrix does not actually store the full matrix in memory; 
# it only stores the cells that are occupied by an item
# this allows the structure to be more memory efficient than an equivalently sized matrix or data frame

# 9835 rows refer to the store transactions
# 169 columns are features for each of the 169 different items that might appear in someone's grocery basket
# each cell in the matrix is a 1 if the item was purchased for the corresponding transaction, or 0 otherwise

# density value of 0.02609146 (2.6 percent) refers to the proportion of non-zero matrix cells

# as there are 9835 * 169 = 1662115 positions in the matrix, we can calculate 
# that a total of 1662115 * 0.02609146 = 43367 items were purchased during the store's 30 days of operation 
# assuming no duplicate items were purchased

# the average transaction contained 43367 / 9835 = 4.409 different grocery items

# the function lists the items that were most commonly found in the transactional data
# as 2513 / 9835 = 0.2555, we can determine that whole milk appeared in 25.6 percent of transactions

# a total of 2,159 transactions contained only a single item, while one transaction had 32 items
# first quartile and median purchase size are 2 and 3 items respectively

# 5 transactions and 169 possible items we requested
# cells in the matrix are filled with black for transactions (rows) where the item (column) was purchased

# it may help with the identification of potential data issues
# columns that are filled all the way down could indicate items that are purchased in every transaction

# patterns in the diagram may help reveal interesting segments of transactions or items, 
# particularly if the data is sorted in interesting ways
# e.g. if the transactions are sorted by date, patterns in the black dots could reveal 
# seasonal effects in the number or types of items people purchase

# this visualization could be especially powerful if the items were also sorted into categories
# it will not be as useful for extremely large transaction databases because the cells will be too small to discern
